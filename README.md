### Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer from Canada.

I tend to keep my work and personal projects seperate, so you'll only see the latter on my Github account. Learn more about me on my [website](https://www.jpettit.ca) or check out some of my side projects right here.

👨‍💻 Projects I’m currently working on:
- Completing coding challenges (private repo for now)
- Developing some handy [python scripts](https://github.com/j-pettit/useful-scripts)
- Creating [classifiers](https://github.com/j-pettit/iris-classification) with machine learning libraries
- Maintaining my [website](https://github.com/j-pettit/j-pettit.github.io)

🏆 Projects I've completed:
- Self-aligning tripod design project - [TrackPod](https://github.com/TrackPod)
- Autonomous passenger [detection](https://github.com/j-pettit/UWAFT-passenger-detection) for the University of Waterloo alternative fuels team
